# NanoGPT API Documentation

## Introduction

The NanoGPT API allows you to generate text, images and video using any AI model available. Our implementation for text generation generally matches the OpenAI standards.

## Endpoints

### Models (GET /v1/models)

OpenAI-compatible endpoint for retrieving available models with optional detailed information including pricing.

**Authentication:** Bearer token (optional, enables user-specific pricing in detailed mode)

**Query Parameters:**
- `detailed` (boolean, default: false): Returns detailed model information including pricing

**Endpoint Variants:**
- `GET /api/v1/models` (canonical): Returns all visible text models. If your account has a subscription and you have not enabled "Also show paid models", this list is automatically restricted to subscription-included models.
- `GET /api/subscription/v1/models` (subscription-only): Always returns only models included in the NanoGPT subscription; ignores the "Also show paid models" preference. Supports `?detailed=true`.
- `GET /api/paid/v1/models` (paid/extras): Returns only models not included in the subscription. Supports `?detailed=true`.

## Miscellaneous Information

### Client Libraries

#### JavaScript - NanoGPTJS

[NanoGPTJS](https://github.com/kilkelly/nanogptjs) is a Node.js library to interact with NanoGPT's API. The NanoGPT service enables pay-per-prompt interaction with chat and image generation models. You will need a prefilled NanoGPT wallet and API key to use this library effectively.

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install nanogptjs
```

**Basic Usage:**
```javascript
const NanoGPT = require('nanogptjs');
const nanogpt = new NanoGPT('your-api-key');

async function chatExample() {
  const response = await nanogpt.chat({
    model: 'openai/gpt-5.2',
    messages: [
      { role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }
    ]
  });
  console.log(response);
}
```

#### TypeScript - NanoGPT-client

[NanoGPT-client](https://github.com/aspic/nanogpt-client) is an unofficial implementation of the NanoGPT API. This library aims to provide a TypeScript client for both browser and node environments. It's built on the inferred OpenAPI spec.

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install nanogpt-client
```

**Basic Usage:**
```typescript
import { NanoGPTClient } from 'nanogpt-client';

const client = new NanoGPTClient({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key'
});

async function main() {
  const response = await client.chatCompletions.create({
    model: 'openai/gpt-5.2',
    messages: [
      { role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }
    ]
  });
  console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
}
```

### Rate Limits

The NanoGPT API currently does not impose any rate limits on API requests. You can make as many requests as needed without worrying about hitting artificial limits.

However, we recommend implementing reasonable request patterns in your applications to ensure optimal performance and fairness for all users.

### Pricing

Detailed pricing information can be found on our [pricing page](https://nano-gpt.com/pricing).

### For Providers

We work together with many providers. If you think you offer models that we don't have yet, or can offer models for a lower price, feel free to reach out to us either at support@nano-gpt.com or find us on our Discord.

To speed things up, mention the following in your email:

- Company name
- How to best get in touch with you. We mostly Discord, email and Twitter in that order.
- Why should we add you?
  - Do you have low prices?
  - Any models others don't have?
  - Any volume discounts you can offer?
  - Do you run models in a special way (decentralized backend, etc)
- What rate limits do you have?
- Do you support credit card payments? Crypto payments? Automaticp ayments?
- Do you have an OpenAI compatible endpoint?
- What is your privacy policy? Do you log prompts? If so, how long do you store them?
- Any other information that seems relevant
