## API Authentication (Recommended)

Most integrations should use an **API key**.

### API key format

New keys use the format:

```text
sk-nano-<uuid>
```

Some older accounts may still have **legacy** keys (a plain UUID). Both formats are accepted.

### Send your key (headers)

Use one of these headers on every request:

1. `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` (recommended)
2. `X-API-Key: <API_KEY>`

Example:

```bash
curl "https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1/models" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-nano-YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Common errors

- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing/invalid/revoked API key (or your key is inactive/expired, if your account has expiration enabled)
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded

For rate-limit details, see [Rate Limits](/api-reference/miscellaneous/rate-limits).

### Getting an API key

Create and manage API keys in the NanoGPT dashboard: [https://nano-gpt.com/api](https://nano-gpt.com/api)

## CLI Authentication (Device Login)

If you're building a CLI, use **device login** so users can approve access in a browser and your CLI receives an API key (`sk-nano-...`).

See: [CLI Device Login](/integrations/cli-login)

## Web App Sign-In (Browser)

If you are using the NanoGPT web app, sign-in is handled via browser sessions. Supported sign-in methods include:

- OAuth (GitHub, Google)
- Email one-time code (magic link / verification code)
- Email/password (or username/password, where supported)
- Passkey (WebAuthn)

If you are calling the API from a backend service, prefer API keys instead of relying on browser cookies.

## API Key Security Best Practices

- Store keys in environment variables (for example: `NANOGPT_API_KEY`).
- Never commit keys to git or ship them in client-side code.
- Prefer `Authorization: Bearer ...` over putting keys in URLs.
- Use separate keys per app/environment so you can revoke access without breaking everything.
- Set spending and request limits (if available for your account) to cap blast radius.
