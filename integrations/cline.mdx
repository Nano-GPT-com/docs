# Using Cline with NanoGPT

A quick guide to setting up Cline with NanoGPT's API.

## Setup Instructions

1. Get your API key from [nano-gpt.com/api](https://nano-gpt.com/api)
2. In Cline settings, add a new Custom Model with these details:
   - API Provider: OpenAI Compatible
   - Base URL: https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1/
   - API Key: Your key from step 1
   - Model ID: gpt-4o

That's it! You can now use Cline with every model you can think of. Model names are on our [pricing page](https://nano-gpt.com/pricing) - important ones are o1, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, yi-lightning, deepseek/deepseek-chat, or just any other model you fancy.

## Using Models with Cline

Once configured, you can start using NanoGPT models through Cline:

```bash
cline chat -m nanogpt:chatgpt-4o-latest "What's the weather like today?"
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Setting Default Model

You can set NanoGPT as your default provider:

```bash
cline config set default.provider nanogpt
cline config set default.model chatgpt-4o-latest
```

Then simply use:

```bash
cline chat "Tell me a story about space exploration"
```

### Using System Prompts

Cline allows you to set system prompts for more controlled outputs:

```bash
cline chat --system "You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in programming" "How do I implement a binary search tree in Python?"
```

## Streaming Responses

By default, Cline streams responses from the API. To disable streaming:

```bash
cline chat --no-stream "Explain quantum computing"
```

## Additional Features

- **Multimodal Inputs**: Cline supports uploading images and files for models that accept them
- **Custom Templates**: Create and reuse prompt templates for consistent interactions
- **History Management**: Review and continue past conversations
