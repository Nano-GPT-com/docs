# Using Cursor with NanoGPT

A quick guide to setting up Cursor with NanoGPT's API.

## Setup Instructions

1. Get your API key from [nano-gpt.com/api](https://nano-gpt.com/api)
2. In Cursor settings:
   - Override OpenAI Base URL with: https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1/
   - Set the API Key to your NanoGPT API key
   - Click "+ Add Model" to add any of our models you want to use

That's it! You can now use any of our models in Cursor. Available models include o1, claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, yi-lightning, deepseek/deepseek-chat, and many more.

Want to explore available models? Visit our [pricing page](https://nano-gpt.com/pricing).

## Usage Tips

1. **Smart Code Completion**: Press Tab when Cursor suggests code completions
2. **Chat Interface**: Use Ctrl+L (or Cmd+L on Mac) to open the AI chat
3. **Code Explanation**: Select code and press Ctrl+Shift+E to explain it
4. **Generate Tests**: Select a function and use the command palette to generate tests

## Custom Commands

Cursor allows you to create custom commands for specific coding tasks. For example:

1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Type "Edit Custom Commands"
3. Add a new command like:

```json
{
  "name": "Document Function",
  "description": "Create documentation for the selected function",
  "prompt": "Write comprehensive documentation for this function following the project's style. Include parameters, return values, and examples:\n\n{{selection}}"
}
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. Start by describing what you want to build to Cursor
2. Let Cursor generate the initial code structure
3. Iteratively refine the code with more specific prompts
4. Ask for optimizations or improvements to your code
