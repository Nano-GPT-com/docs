# Using OpenHands with NanoGPT

A quick guide to setting up OpenHands with NanoGPT's API.

## Setup Instructions

1. Get your API key from [nano-gpt.com/api](https://nano-gpt.com/api)
2. In OpenHands, add a new LLM Endpoint and toggle "Advanced".
3. Configure the fields as follows:
   - Custom Model: `openai/<MODEL_NAME_FROM_NANOGPT>`
     - Example: `openai/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
     - If a model name contains a slash, include it: e.g. `openai/deepseek/deepseek-chat`
   - Base URL: `https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1` (no trailing slash)
   - API Key: Your key from step 1
   - Search API Key (Tavily): Optional
   - Agent: `CodeActAgent` (recommended)

## Important Notes

- The Base URL must NOT end with a `/`. Use `https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1` exactly.
- Prefix the model with `openai/` and use the exact model name as shown by the NanoGPT API or on our pricing page.

You can now use OpenHands with any NanoGPT model. Popular choices include `o1`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `yi-lightning`, and `deepseek/deepseek-chat`. For a full list, check our [pricing page](https://nano-gpt.com/pricing).
