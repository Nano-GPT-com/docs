# Using Roo Code with NanoGPT

A quick guide to setting up Roo Code with NanoGPT's API.

## Setup Instructions

1. Get your API key from [nano-gpt.com/api](https://nano-gpt.com/api)
2. In Roo Code settings, add a new Custom Model with these details:
   - API Provider: OpenAI Compatible
   - Base URL: https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1thinking/
   - API Key: Your key from step 1
   - Model ID: openai/gpt-5.2

> **Tip:** Roo Code surfaces the `thinking` and `response` channels side-by-side. Pointing it at `https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1thinking/` keeps that richer reasoning stream intact for models like Minimax M2 or Kimi K2 Thinking.

That's it! You can now use Roo Code with every model you can think of. Model names are on our [pricing page](https://nano-gpt.com/pricing) - important ones are openai/gpt-5.2, anthropic/claude-opus-4.5, google/gemini-3-flash-preview, or just any other model you fancy.
