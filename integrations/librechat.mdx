# Using LibreChat with NanoGPT

A quick guide to setting up LibreChat with NanoGPT's API.

## Setup Instructions

1. Get your API key from [nano-gpt.com/api](https://nano-gpt.com/api)
2. Locate your LibreChat installation's `librechat.example.yml` file
3. Create a copy named `librechat.yml`
4. Add the following configuration to your `librechat.yml`:

```yaml
# NanoGPT Example
- name: 'NanoGPT'
  apiKey: '${NANO_GPT_API_KEY}'
  baseURL: 'https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1/'
  models:
      default: [
        "chatgpt-4o-latest",
        "gpt-4o-mini",
        ]
      fetch: true
  titleConvo: true
  titleModel: 'gpt-4o-mini'
  modelDisplayLabel: 'NanoGPT'

```

5. Set your API key in your environment variables:
