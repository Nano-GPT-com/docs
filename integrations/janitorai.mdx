# Using JanitorAI with NanoGPT

A quick guide to connecting JanitorAI chats to NanoGPT's API.

## Setup Instructions

1. Get your API key from [nano-gpt.com/api](https://nano-gpt.com/api)
2. In JanitorAI, open the **Settings → AI Providers** panel
3. Select **Custom / OpenAI Compatible** as the provider
4. Configure the connection with the following values:

   ```text
   Base URL: https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1/
   Endpoint: chat/completions
   API Key: <your NanoGPT key>
   ```

5. Pick the NanoGPT model you want to use (for example `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `o1`, etc.)

JanitorAI now routes your conversations through NanoGPT's standard OpenAI-compatible endpoint. All models listed on our [pricing page](https://nano-gpt.com/pricing) are available.

## Showing Reasoning Traces

JanitorAI can also display the internal reasoning returned by thinking-capable models. To enable this:

1. Duplicate the configuration above.
2. Replace the base URL with `https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1thinking/`.
3. Keep `chat/completions` as the endpoint and continue to use your NanoGPT API key.

Requests sent to `v1thinking/chat` include the model's reasoning trace in the response body, allowing JanitorAI to render thoughts alongside the final answer. The standard `v1/chat` endpoint omits this field if you prefer clean responses.

You can maintain both connections in JanitorAI—use the regular `v1` endpoint when you only want the assistant's replies, and switch to the `v1thinking` endpoint whenever you need to inspect the chain-of-thought output.
