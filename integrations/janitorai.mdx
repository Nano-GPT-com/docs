# Using JanitorAI with NanoGPT

A quick guide to connecting JanitorAI chats to NanoGPT's API.

## Setup Instructions

1. Get your API key from [nano-gpt.com/api](https://nano-gpt.com/api)
2. In JanitorAI, open the **Settings â†’ AI Providers** panel
3. Select **Custom / OpenAI Compatible** as the provider
4. Configure the connection with the following values:

   ```text
   Base URL: https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1thinking/
   Endpoint: chat/completions
   API Key: <your NanoGPT key>
   ```

5. Pick the NanoGPT model you want to use (for example `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, `o1`, etc.)

JanitorAI now routes your conversations through NanoGPT's reasoning-friendly endpoint, so every response includes the model's internal thoughts alongside the final answer. All models listed on our [pricing page](https://nano-gpt.com/pricing) are available.

## Plain responses only

If you prefer to hide the reasoning pane, duplicate the configuration above and change the base URL to `https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1/` while keeping `chat/completions` as the endpoint. The v1 endpoint omits reasoning fields entirely, delivering just the assistant's reply.
