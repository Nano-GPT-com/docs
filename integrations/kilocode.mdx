# Using Kilo Code with NanoGPT

A quick guide to setting up Kilo Code with NanoGPT's API.

## Setup Instructions

1. Get your API key from [nano-gpt.com/api](https://nano-gpt.com/api)
2. In Kilo Code settings, add a new Custom Model with these details:
   - API Provider: OpenAI Compatible
   - Base URL: https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1/
   - API Key: Your key from step 1
   - Model ID: openai/gpt-5.2

That's it! You can now use Kilo Code with every model you can think of. Model names are on our [pricing page](https://nano-gpt.com/pricing) - important ones are openai/gpt-5.2, anthropic/claude-opus-4.5, google/gemini-3-flash-preview, or just any other model you fancy.
