title: "Voice Cloning"
description: "Clone voices from reference audio and reuse them with compatible TTS models"
---

## Overview

NanoGPT supports voice cloning so you can create reusable custom voices from short reference audio clips and then use them in text-to-speech (TTS).

There are two voice-clone providers exposed via NanoGPT:

- **MiniMax voice clone**: creates a reusable `customVoiceId` you can pass as `voice` when using compatible MiniMax Speech TTS models.
- **Qwen voice clone (1.7B)**: generates a speaker embedding file URL that you can pass to Qwen 3 TTS as `speaker_voice_embedding_file_url`.

Both flows are asynchronous:

1. Submit a clone job, receive a `runId` (HTTP 202).
2. Poll the status endpoint until `status: "completed"`.

## Authentication

All voice clone endpoints support:

- API key auth: `x-api-key: <your NanoGPT API key>` (or `Authorization: Bearer <key>`)
- Session auth (web app): browser cookies

## Endpoints

| Provider | Submit | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MiniMax | `POST /api/voice-clone/minimax` | `POST /api/voice-clone/minimax/status` |
| Qwen | `POST /api/voice-clone/qwen` | `POST /api/voice-clone/qwen/status` |

## MiniMax Voice Clone

  "paymentSource": "USD",
  "isApiRequest": true,
  "fileName": "audio_file",
  "fileSize": 0
}
```

### Poll Job Status

```
POST /api/voice-clone/qwen/status
```

**Request body**
```json
{
  "runId": "fal-request-id-789",
  "cost": 0.25,
  "paymentSource": "USD",
  "isApiRequest": true

```

**Response headers**

While the job is still processing, the response may include an `X-Poll-After` header indicating how many seconds to wait before polling again.

**Response (completed)**
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "speakerEmbeddingUrl": "https://storage.example.com/speaker-embedding.safetensors",
  "metadata": {
    "model": "qwen-voice-clone"
  }
}
```

## Using Cloned Voices with TTS

### MiniMax cloned voice (`customVoiceId`)

Use your `customVoiceId` as the normal `voice` on `POST /api/tts` with a compatible MiniMax Speech TTS model:

```json
{
  "text": "Text you want spoken in the cloned voice.",
  "voice": "MyVoice001",
  "model": "Minimax-Speech-02-HD",
  "speed": 1
}
```

### Qwen cloned voice (`speakerEmbeddingUrl`)

Use `speakerEmbeddingUrl` as `speaker_voice_embedding_file_url` on `POST /api/tts` with `Qwen-3-TTS-1.7B`:

```json
{
  "text": "Text you want spoken in the cloned voice.",
  "model": "Qwen-3-TTS-1.7B",
  "speaker_voice_embedding_file_url": "https://storage.example.com/speaker-embedding.safetensors",
  "reference_text": "Optional: transcript of the original reference audio.",
  "language": "Auto"
}
```

## Saving MiniMax Voice IDs (Web App)

If you use the NanoGPT web app, you can save and list your MiniMax `customVoiceId` values.

These endpoints are **session-authenticated only** (they do not support API key auth).

### List Saved Voice IDs

```
GET /api/user/voice-ids
```

**Response**
```json
{
  "voiceIds": ["MyVoice001", "MyVoice002"]
}
```

### Save a Voice ID

```
POST /api/user/voice-ids
```

**Request body**
```json
{
  "voiceId": "MyVoice001"
}
```

**Response**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "voiceIds": ["MyVoice001", "MyVoice002"]
}
```

## Pricing

Clone runs are charged as a flat per-run fee:

- MiniMax voice clone: $1.00 per run
- Qwen voice clone (1.7B): $0.25 per run

The submit response includes `cost` and `paymentSource` for the run.

## Limitations

- Both providers are asynchronous; clients must poll status until completion.
- MiniMax `customVoiceId` must match `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]{7,}$`.
