title: "Voice Cloning"
description: "Clone voices from reference audio and reuse them with compatible TTS models"
---

## Overview

NanoGPT supports voice cloning so you can create reusable custom voices from short reference audio clips and then use them in text-to-speech (TTS).

There are two voice-clone providers exposed via NanoGPT:

- **MiniMax voice clone**: creates a reusable `customVoiceId` you can pass as `voice` when using compatible MiniMax Speech TTS models.
- **Qwen voice clone (1.7B)**: generates a speaker embedding file URL that you can pass to Qwen 3 TTS as `speaker_voice_embedding_file_url`.

Both flows are asynchronous:

1. Submit a clone job, receive a `runId` (HTTP 202).
2. Poll the status endpoint until `status: "completed"`.

## Authentication

All voice clone endpoints support:

- API key auth: `x-api-key: <your NanoGPT API key>` (or `Authorization: Bearer <key>`)
- Session auth (web app): browser cookies

## Endpoints

| Provider | Submit | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MiniMax | `POST /api/voice-clone/minimax` | `POST /api/voice-clone/minimax/status` |
| Qwen | `POST /api/voice-clone/qwen` | `POST /api/voice-clone/qwen/status` |

  }
}
```

## Using Cloned Voices with TTS

### MiniMax cloned voice (`customVoiceId`)

Use your `customVoiceId` as the normal `voice` on `POST /api/tts` with a compatible MiniMax Speech TTS model:

```json
{
  "text": "Text you want spoken in the cloned voice.",
  "voice": "MyVoice001",
  "model": "Minimax-Speech-02-HD",
  "speed": 1
}
```

### Qwen cloned voice (`speakerEmbeddingUrl`)

Use `speakerEmbeddingUrl` as `speaker_voice_embedding_file_url` on `POST /api/tts` with `Qwen-3-TTS-1.7B`:

```json
{
  "text": "Text you want spoken in the cloned voice.",
  "model": "Qwen-3-TTS-1.7B",
  "speaker_voice_embedding_file_url": "https://storage.example.com/speaker-embedding.safetensors",
  "reference_text": "Optional: transcript of the original reference audio.",
  "language": "Auto"
}
```

## Saving MiniMax Voice IDs (Web App)

If you use the NanoGPT web app, you can save and list your MiniMax `customVoiceId` values.

These endpoints are **session-authenticated only** (they do not support API key auth).

### List Saved Voice IDs

```
GET /api/user/voice-ids
```

**Response**
```json
{
  "voiceIds": ["MyVoice001", "MyVoice002"]
}
```

### Save a Voice ID

```
POST /api/user/voice-ids
```

**Request body**
```json
{
  "voiceId": "MyVoice001"
}
```

**Response**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "voiceIds": ["MyVoice001", "MyVoice002"]
}
```

## Voice Clone Storage and Retention

Last verified: February 21, 2026.

Retention depends on the provider behind each voice clone model:

- `minimax-voice-clone` (WaveSpeed + MiniMax):
  New cloned voice IDs are temporary. If a cloned voice is not used in a real TTS synthesis call within 7 days (168 hours), it is deleted. If it is used at least once in TTS within that window, it is kept long-term. Preview generated during clone creation does not activate or persist the voice.
- `qwen-voice-clone` (fal.ai):
  The returned speaker embedding file URL is hosted by fal. fal guarantees hosted generated files for at least 7 days, then they may be removed at any time. Download and store the embedding yourself immediately for long-term reuse.
- `inworld-voice-clone` (Inworld Voice API, if enabled in your workspace):
  Inworld does not publish a fixed auto-delete window for cloned voices in public docs. Treat cloned voices as persistent until explicitly deleted from your workspace.
  Note: Inworld's Zero Data Retention mode explicitly does not apply to voice-cloning audio samples.

## How to Keep and Reuse Voice Clones

### MiniMax / WaveSpeed (`customVoiceId`)

1. Save the returned voice ID (`customVoiceId`; provider docs may also call this `voice_id`).
2. Run at least one real TTS synthesis with that voice ID within 7 days.
3. Reuse the same voice ID in later TTS requests.

### Qwen (`speakerEmbeddingUrl`)

1. Save the returned `speakerEmbeddingUrl` (`speaker_embedding_url` in some provider docs).
2. Download the embedding file right away.
3. Store it in your own durable storage (S3, R2, etc.).
4. Use your stored URL later as `speaker_voice_embedding_file_url`.

Example:

```bash
curl -L "$SPEAKER_EMBEDDING_URL" -o my-voice.safetensors
```

### Inworld (`voice_id`, if enabled)

1. Save the returned `voice_id`.
2. Reuse it directly for Inworld TTS.
3. If deleted from Inworld, it must be re-cloned.

## Can I Download the Clone if It Gets Deleted?

- MiniMax / WaveSpeed: no portable voice embedding download is documented; keep the voice ID active by using it in time.
- Qwen: yes, download the speaker embedding file from `speakerEmbeddingUrl` / `speaker_embedding_url`.
- Inworld: no documented voice-embedding export endpoint; keep the `voice_id` and avoid accidental deletion.

> **Warning:** Provider retention policies may change. This page reflects provider docs as of February 21, 2026.

## Pricing

Clone runs are charged as a flat per-run fee:

- MiniMax voice clone: $1.00 per run
- Qwen voice clone (1.7B): $0.25 per run

The submit response includes `cost` and `paymentSource` for the run.

## Limitations

- MiniMax and Qwen clone endpoints are asynchronous; clients must poll status until completion.
- MiniMax `customVoiceId` must match `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]{7,}$`.
