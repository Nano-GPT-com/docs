title: 'Image Generation (OpenAI-Compatible)'
openapi: 'POST /v1/images/generations'

Each `data[i]` contains either `b64_json` (default) or `url` (when `response_format: "url"`), never both.

When requesting `response_format: "url"`, the API may still return `b64_json` if URL generation (upload/presign) fails, as a fallback.
