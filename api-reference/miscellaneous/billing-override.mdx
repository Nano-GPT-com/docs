# Pay-As-You-Go Billing Override (API)

This override forces a request to be treated as paid (pay-as-you-go), even when the user has an active subscription and the model is subscription-included. It is intended for API documentation and support.

## What It Does

- Forces a request to be treated as paid (pay-as-you-go).
- Bypasses subscription coverage for that request.
- Allows provider selection on subscription-included models when the model supports provider selection.
- Applies provider selection markup when a provider is explicitly chosen.
- Does not change which models support provider selection.

## When to Use It

Use `billing_mode: "paygo"` when:

- A subscriber wants to select a specific upstream provider for a model.
- A subscriber wants to pay per-request even if the model is normally covered by subscription.

## Supported Inputs

**Header**

- `X-Billing-Mode: paygo` (header name is case-insensitive)
- `x-billing-mode` is also accepted

**Body (all endpoints)**

- `"billing_mode": "paygo"`
- Alias: `"billingMode": "paygo"`

**Accepted values (case-insensitive)**

- `paygo`
- `pay-as-you-go`
- `pay_as_you_go`
- `paid`
- `payg`

**Precedence**: Body value wins if both body and header are present.

## API Examples

Chat Completions:

```http
POST /api/v1/chat/completions
X-Billing-Mode: paygo
X-Provider: your_provider_id

{
  "model": "zai-org/GLM-4.6",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "Hello" }
  ]
}
```

Completions:

```http
POST /api/v1/completions
X-Billing-Mode: paygo
X-Provider: your_provider_id

{
  "model": "zai-org/GLM-4.6",
  "prompt": "Hello"
}
```

Responses:

```http
POST /api/v1/responses
X-Billing-Mode: paygo

{
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "input": "Hello"
}
```

## Provider Selection Notes

- Provider selection only works for models that support it.
- If a model does not support provider selection, `X-Provider` is ignored.
- For provider-selectable models, the request is treated as paid and provider selection markup applies when a provider is explicitly chosen.

## Subscription and Limits Behavior

When `billing_mode: "paygo"` is set:

- The request is not eligible for subscription coverage.
- Subscription quota is not consumed.
- Pay-as-you-go balance checks apply as normal.

If `subscription.enablePaidModelsApi` is `false`, the request is rejected (same as any other paid API request).

## FAQ

**Does this affect which models are available?**
No. It only changes billing eligibility. Model availability is unchanged.

**Does it force a provider for non-selectable models?**
No. It only affects billing, not routing, unless the model supports provider selection.

**Can I combine this with BYOK?**
Yes. BYOK still works; paygo override only changes subscription eligibility.
