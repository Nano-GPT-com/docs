# Rate Limits

The NanoGPT API currently does not impose any rate limits on API requests. You can make as many requests as needed without worrying about hitting artificial limits.

However, we recommend implementing reasonable request patterns in your applications to ensure optimal performance and fairness for all users.

If rate limits are implemented in the future, this documentation will be updated accordingly.
