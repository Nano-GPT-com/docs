We work together with many providers. If you think you offer models that we don't have yet, can offer models for a lower price or have some other reason we should integrate you, feel free to reach out to us either at support@nano-gpt.com or find us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/KaQt8gPG6V). 

To speed things up, mention the following in your email:

- Company name
- How to best get in touch with you. We mostly use Discord, email and Twitter in that order.
- Why should we add you?
  - Do you have low prices?
  - Any models others don't have?
  - Any volume discounts you can offer?
  - Do you run models in a special way (decentralized backend, etc)
- What rate limits do you have?
- What is your privacy policy? Do you log prompts? If so, how long do you store them?
- Do you support credit card payments? Crypto payments? Automatic payments?
- Do you have an OpenAI compatible endpoint?
- Any other information that seems relevant
